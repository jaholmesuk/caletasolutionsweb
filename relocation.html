										<h2>Any IT relocation project is complex and requires a lot of planning</h2>
                                    </header>
                                        <p>Typically this will start with an initial assessment and survey undertaken by your in-house IT team. Many IT relocation projects will then find a business to lift and shift all of the IT equipment without necessarily understanding what IT services are being moved.</p>
									<p>At Caleta IT we have a vast amount of experience in this area. This means we can migrate your critical IT, but also provide skilled engineers and consultants on the ground professionally trained. These skilled people are able to carry out planned assessments and offer recommendations around consolidation and cloud based alternatives, reducing the overall impact and IT relocation requirements.</p>
									<p>IT relocation companies offer services to migrate your IT. However none can provide tailored expert advice and experience as well as offer full end to end solution. All our engineers and consultants are experts with real world Data Centre relocation project experience meaning we can help with all aspects of the migration including power on and tests pre and post migration.

										<h2>Here is an example where we can offer a different service to our competitors</h2>
                                    </header>
                                        <p>A company needs to migrate their IT estate comprising of 800 servers from site A to site B over 500 miles away. The company has a cloud subscription in Microsoft Azure. Other IT relocation companies offer to migrate all 800 servers from A to B. At Caleta IT we go a step further as our experts initially complete a full assessment and we immediately find 400 servers can be consolidated to 200. A further 100 servers can be easily migrated to Azure which means only 300 servers need to be migrated from site A to B.</p>
								<p>Using experienced IT professionals to plan your migration could actually save the business money. In this example the money saved after consolidating servers and migrating cloud workloads meant the overall cost to migrate was offset. After consolidating and migrating services to the Cloud the business was able to save an additional Â£200,000 annually due to the reduced Data Centre footprint.</p>
